# Classification-of-NASA-ISS-Imagery
Exploring options for using data science and machine learning tools on images of the earth taken from NASA's International Space Station (ISS)

The International Space Station is a collaborative effort between 18 countries to explore living in and performing scientific and engineering operations in a low-Earth orbiting station in space. Since 1998, crew members travelling to and living in the 
ISS have taken millions of images of Earth, achieving everything from highlighting natural disasters: https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/08/nasas-pictures-of-the-california-wildfires-from-space.html, to demonstrating the geopolitical issues in a region: https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/02/140226-north-korea-satellite-photos-darkness-energy/, to, of course, providing us with spetacular views of the earth: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stunning-photos-of-earth-from-the-international-space-station1/#.  So it is clear to see the value that these images provide.  

Unfortunately, with most image data collection platforms, the challenge lies in finding ways to automatically identify or classify these large datasets.  There are features in this dataset that make it unique and different from most ground-based imagery datasets. For instance, camera angles vary distinctly which causes distortions in the image, as well as variations in direction, where north is not necessarily at the top of the image.  There are also huge variations in lighting (ie day vs night and aurora imagery) and weather features, where cloud coverage can sometimes be the feature of the image (ie images of hurricanes) or can sometimes completely obscure the actual target. 

In this project, I'm going to explore all of this and see how I can use data science to answer some of these questions and identify a machine learning tool that will help to automatically classify the content of each image.
